Pokemon Battler is an interactive command-line game, built by Jo Watson using class syntax in Javascript and the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package. The classes and functionality have all been fully tested with Jest. Pick your pokemon and go head-to-head against a wild pokemon, all from the comfort of your terminal.... because who needs [sprites](https://pokemondb.net/sprites), anyway :)
